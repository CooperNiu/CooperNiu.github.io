## Resiliency 

* [ ] My application can retain reasonable functionality in isolation
* [ ] My application can recover from being under heavy load
* [ ] My application can reestablish all lost connections
* [ ] My application can not cause Cascading Failures to propagate through the system

## 

## Load balancing

* [ ] My project can run on multiple CPUs
* [ ] My project can run behind the load balancer
* [ ] I can add a new node without system downtime

## Transparent deployment

* [ ] I can make a rolling upgrades for my service

## Supervising

* [ ] My application can survive a server restart
* [ ] My application is restarted automatically after the crash
  

## Logging

## High Availability

* [ ] I can run my services in different independent Data Centers


## Testing

* [ ] I have performed stress tests for my application
* [ ] I have performed network partitioning tests for my application


## Backuping

* [ ] I can restore all my data from backups


## Security
